# DigitalPainting
Hi there! Using Javascript, HTML and CSS, I created a digital painting website. The website starts off with instructions on how to use it. Additionally there are options to input height and width, to adjust the dimensions of the canvas. Subsequently, a user can change the colour and size of the brush that is used to paint on the canvas. 

<Tip>
that is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices. Tip To allow for responsiveness duality, JavaScript code was modified to handle touch events in addition to mouse events.
