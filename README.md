# DigitalPainting
Hi there! Using Javascript, HTML and CSS, I created a digital painting website. The website starts off with instructions on how to use it. Additionally there are options to input height and width, to adjust the dimensions of the canvas. Subsequently, a user can change the colour and size of the brush that is used to paint on the canvas.

  <p>In order to make the website responsive on both desktop and mobile devices, adjustments were made to the JavaScript code to handle touch events alongside mouse events. This ensures that the website can provide an optimal user experience on various screen sizes and input methods.</p>
